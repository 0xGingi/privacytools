## Overview
    Features, pages descriptions , design overview

## Contributing
    
This website is made with HTML5, CSS and Javascript. It doesn't have any dependencies.
But why? We all know that frameworks are awesome but for a big project like this with a lot of pages ad resources we decided that using only small libraries and pure Web development is perfect to balance the speed with the content in a clean and simple design.

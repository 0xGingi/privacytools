      Techlore is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed
      to help you understand what information we gather, how we use it, what we do to protect it, and to assist you in
      making informed decisions when using our Service. Unless otherwise indicated below, this Privacy Policy applies to
      any website that references this Privacy Policy.
      <br>
      <br>
      For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to our services which can be accessed via our website at
      https://www.techlore.tech. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Techlore. “You” refers to you, as a user of
      our services.

        <summary> I. CONSENT</summary>
        <div>
          By accessing our Service, you accept our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and you consent to our collection,
          storage,
          use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, by using our
          Service,
          or services across partnered and unaffiliated sites, you are accepting the policies and practices described in
          this Privacy Policy.
          Each time you visit our website, or use the Service, and any time you voluntarily provide us with information,
          you agree that you are consenting to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide,
          and you are consenting to receive emails or otherwise be contacted, as described in this Privacy Policy.

        <summary> II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</summary>
        <div>
          We may collect both “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information” about you.
          “Non-Personal Information” includes information that cannot be directly used to personally identify you, such
          as
          usage data,
          general demographic information, referring/exit pages and URLs, and platform types.
          This is standard on most hosting services and we’ve disabled everything we can to collect as little as
          possible.
          “Personal Information” includes information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name and
          email address.
          “Personal Information” is only ever collected if you optionally submit it to us.

          We do not utilize cookies, and we do not implement any trackers on our website to analyze your behavior.
        </div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary> III. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</summary>
        <div>
          Personal Information:

          We do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your Personal Information with third parties. We may share your
          Personal Information with vendors and other third-party providers who are performing services for us. In
          general, the vendors and third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information
          to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide for the service. For example, when
          you provide us with personal information to contact us, you consent to our collecting and using such personal
          information for that specific purpose, including by transmitting such information to our vendors (and their
          service providers) performing these services.

          However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment processors, have their own privacy policies in
          respect of the information that we are required to provide to them in order to use their services. For these
          third-party service providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so that you can understand
          the
          manner in which your Personal Information will be handled by such providers.

          Non-Personal Information:
          We may use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience.
        </div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>IV. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</summary>
        <div>
          We implement strong precautions to secure any data you submit to us to ensure that such Personal Information
          is
          not accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information
          will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such precautions. By using our Service, you
          acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
        </div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary> V. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</summary>
        <div>
          As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or applications. However,
          we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they
          contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Service. Therefore,
          this
          Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third-party website accessed by selecting a link via our
          Service.
          To the extent that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application, then the
          privacy
          policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application. We
          encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.

        <summary> VI. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</summary>
        <div>
          We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. If we decide to change
          this
          Privacy Policy, we will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we
          collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. It is your sole responsibility to check
          this website from time to time to view any such changes to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not
          agree
          to any changes, if and when such changes may be made to this Privacy Policy, you must cease access to this
          website.
